# Morning Standup - January 13, 2026

## Project: RealCoach.ai (RC1.5)
**Branch:** main
**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026 (Add MVP blockers: Mailchimp queue processor, signal handoff, and docs)

---

## Recent Activity (Last 7 Days)

Major work completed this week:

1. **Screenshots Interpretation v1** - Vision AI integration for CoachPanel
   - Upload context and state machine
   - Interpretation card UI
   - Signal generation and handoff to Daily Action Engine

2. **Mailchimp Sync v1** - One-way contact sync integration
   - OAuth flow (auth, callback, disconnect endpoints)
   - Sync library with queue-based retry logic
   - Background cron job for queue processing (every 15 min)
   - Settings UI for connection management

3. **MVP Blockers Resolved**
   - Queue processor edge function
   - Signal handoff to coaching engine
   - Manual testing guide created
   - README/CLAUDE.md documentation updates

4. **Earlier This Week**
   - UI persistence wiring (Phase 4)
   - CoachPanel refactoring with extracted hooks
   - Google OAuth button added
   - LLM client, daily action engine, and prompts test coverage

## Current Status

**MVP Status: Complete** - All 5 production readiness phases finished.
Two new features (Screenshots Interpretation, Mailchimp Sync) have been implemented but task files not updated.

### Documentation: Needs Attention ⚠️

- CLAUDE.md and README are up to date ✅
- PROGRESS_REPORT.md shows Jan 12, 2026 but doesn't reflect Screenshots/Mailchimp completion
- Task files (`tasks/tasks-*.md`) show 0% checked off but code is actually implemented
- **Gap**: Implementation is ahead of task file tracking

### Tasks: ~85% Complete (estimate)

| Task File | In File | Actual State |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| tasks-supabase-data-layer.md | 100% (14/14 checked) | ✅ Complete |
| tasks-screenshots-interpretation.md | 0% checked | ~90% implemented (code exists) |
| tasks-mailchimp-sync.md | 0% checked | ~85% implemented (code exists, needs testing) |

**Next Steps from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md:**
1. Google OAuth Configuration - Enable in Supabase dashboard
2. E2E Testing - Playwright or Cypress
3. Error Monitoring - Sentry setup
4. Performance Optimization - Code splitting

### Tests: 178 Passing (per docs)

Cannot run tests in this environment due to native module issues, but per documentation:
- prompts.ts: 97% coverage
- daily-action-engine.ts: 95% coverage
- client.ts: 44% coverage

## Sprint Recommendations

### Sprint 1: Task File Cleanup & Manual Testing - Priority: High

**Goal:** Update task files to reflect actual implementation state and complete manual testing per MANUAL_TESTING.md

**Why Now:** Implementation is complete but tracking is broken. Manual testing will validate the features work end-to-end before considering "done."

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update tasks-screenshots-interpretation.md - check off completed items
- [ ] Update tasks-mailchimp-sync.md - check off completed items
- [ ] Complete manual testing checklist from docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md
- [ ] Update PROGRESS_REPORT.md to reflect current state
- [ ] Document any bugs/issues found during testing

**Estimated Effort:** Small (1-2 days)

**Dependencies:** None

**Success Criteria:** Task files match implementation, all manual tests pass, any bugs documented

---

### Sprint 2: Production Hardening - Priority: High

**Goal:** Add error monitoring and finalize production configuration

**Why Now:** MVP is feature-complete but needs production-grade observability before real users.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Enable Google OAuth in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Set up Sentry or similar error tracking
- [ ] Add error boundaries to React components
- [ ] Configure Vercel environment variables for production
- [ ] Test Mailchimp cron job in production environment
- [ ] Review and test RLS policies with real data

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (3-5 days)

**Dependencies:** Manual testing from Sprint 1 complete

**Success Criteria:** Google OAuth works, errors are captured and reported, production deploy verified

---

### Sprint 3: E2E Testing & Polish - Priority: Medium

**Goal:** Add automated end-to-end tests for critical user flows

**Why Now:** Reduces risk for future changes and documents expected behavior.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Playwright or Cypress
- [ ] Write E2E test: Auth flow (signup, login, logout)
- [ ] Write E2E test: Calibration flow (7 questions → G&A confirmation)
- [ ] Write E2E test: Daily actions display
- [ ] Write E2E test: Screenshot upload and interpretation
- [ ] Write E2E test: Contact CRUD and Mailchimp sync trigger
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline

**Estimated Effort:** Large (1-2 weeks)

**Dependencies:** Sprint 2 complete (stable production environment)

**Success Criteria:** 5+ E2E tests covering core flows, integrated with CI

---

## Notes for Today

**Immediate Actions:**
1. The task files are out of sync - this is a documentation debt that should be addressed
2. Manual testing (per MANUAL_TESTING.md) is the critical path before declaring features "done"
3. Google OAuth is a quick config change that unblocks real user signups

**Questions/Blockers:**
- Is Mailchimp OAuth app registered in production? (Needs client ID/secret in Vercel)
- Has Supabase Storage bucket been created for screenshots?
- Are the cron jobs enabled in Vercel production?

**Quick Wins:**
- ✅ Enable Google OAuth in Supabase (5 min)
- ✅ Update task files with checkmarks (30 min)
- ✅ Verify Vercel env vars are set (10 min)
